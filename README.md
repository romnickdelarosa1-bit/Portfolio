# Romnick D. Dela Rosa — Personal Portfolio

A personal portfolio website built for the Integrative Programming and Technology subject at Camarines Norte State College. It showcases my background, skills, and projects while integrating external APIs and interactive transaction features.

## APIs Used

- **QuoteSlate API** — Displays a random motivational quote on the homepage that refreshes on button click.
- **EmailJS** — Handles email sending for the Contact Form and Project Inquiry Modal without a backend.
- **GitHub API** — Fetches and displays my latest public repositories dynamically.

## Transaction Features

- **Contact Form** — Users can send a message directly to my email via EmailJS. Includes field validation and success/error feedback.
- **Feedback Form** — Users can leave feedback that gets saved to localStorage and displayed in a collapsible list.
- **Project Inquiry Modal** — Each project card has an Inquire button that opens a form pre-filled with the project name and sends it via EmailJS.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. An internet connection is required for the APIs (QuoteSlate, GitHub, EmailJS) to work.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
